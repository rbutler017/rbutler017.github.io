<p>Hello. Once again allow me to welcome you to my frogtastic personal webpage. I do a lot of things, most of them are boring and can be viewed in the curriculum vitae on the other page. I've put a few of the not boring things I'm interested in in a bulleted list below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Frogs</li>
  <li>The French Revolution</li>
  <li>Looking for fossils in the woods</li>
  <li>Gardening</li>
  <li>Wallowing in despair over the collapse of East Germany</li>
  <li>BBC Radio 4 Podcasts</li>
  <li>Kantian Ethics</li>
  <li>Drilling deep shale oil wells in my back yard</li>
  <li>Board games</li>
</ul>
<p> I'm a big fan of frogs, are you? </p>

<h2>My 2040 Presidential Campaign</h2>
<img src="https://acegif.com/wp-content/uploads/flag-america-usa.gif" alt="USA Flag">
<p>I have a lot of big ideas on how to improve the United States of America, which is why I'm announcing my 2040 presidential bid well in advance.</p>
<h3>My Platform</h3>
<p>When elected President, I will enact the following 5 measures for the betterment of society</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Rename the title of "President" to "Grand Marshal of the Republic" in addition to adjusting the term limit from 4 years to 1776 years to honor the nation</li>
  <li>Liberate the unjustly held province of Quebec from Canada</li>
  <li><marquee width="200">Reorganize the 50 states into 10732 special economic zones arbitrarily</marquee></li>
  <li>War with England (it's overdue)</li>
  <li>Build a new bicycle lane from the city center of Minot, North Dakota to the amtrack station</li>
</ol>
<p>This plan will rejuvenate the country. I look forward to seeing you all at the polls.</p>
<p>Would you vote for me?</p>
