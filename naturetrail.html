<p>You walk through campus to get to the nature trail. The greek life people only try and give you a pamphlet once.
 which is blissfully less than usual. You reach the trailhead. You notice there is a very good looking stick in the grass next to the entrance. What do you do?</p>
<button class="GFG"
onclick="window.location.href = 'https:stick.html';">
Pick up the stick.
</button>
<button class="GFG"
onclick="window.location.href = 'https:firstbridge.html';">
Walk forward (no stick).
</button>
