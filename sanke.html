<p>You investigate the rustling and spot a small gardner snake. It does not bother you, you do not bother it. It 
slithers away without incident. As you watch it slither away you have feel an ominous sense of foreboding. Something 
abou a war. You don't know have any other feelings beyond that. Odd. You carry on.</p>
