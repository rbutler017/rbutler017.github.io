<p>You look over the edge of the bridge. The water plods along. As you stare into it, you do not see any frogs, but
 you do see visions of a tricolor flag. It looks like one of the colors is red. You cannot make out any further 
details of the mysterios flag. You also think you can hear words emminating from the stream. They sound muddled and 
foreign, certainly not english. Weird.</p>
