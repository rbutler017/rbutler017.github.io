<p>You get down on all fours and lean over the edge of the bridge. Peering into the water, you see several tadpoles 
wriggle about. When you look up, you swear for a second that you see a plaque on the bridge. You thought you saw the dates 1914-1919 on it, but it appears that 
it was just a mirage. You remind yourself to pack more water next time you visit the trail.</p>
